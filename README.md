# Welcome to my Applicant Tracking System!

Looking for a job/internship in this tough market? 

I have created an ATS with the help of Google Gemini Pro Vision which helps you to paste the JD (Job Description) from any website (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and also allows to upload your resume/cv and based on that, it gives you how much percentage your resume aligns with the JD. Also, it gives you missing keywords that you might need to include in your resume and increase your chance of getting your resume match with the JD which might increase your chances of getting an interview call too

To use this, follow these steps:

1 - git clone this repo
2 - run the app.py file from the terminal like - streamlit run app.py
3 - An app will open in the browser where you need to first copy paste the JD in the JD box and upload your latest resume. After that, click    Submit and get your output

Hope this helps you! Feel free reaching out to me if you need any help or have any doubts regarding this application. Would like to help you in a best possible way.

Thanks!

YOU GOT THIS !!!!
